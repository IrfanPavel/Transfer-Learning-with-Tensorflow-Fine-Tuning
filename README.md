# Transfer-Learning-with-Tensorflow-Fine-Tuning

In fine-tuning transfer learning the pre-trained model weights from another model are unfrozen and tweaked during to better suit your own data.

For feature extraction transfer learning, you may only train the top 1-3 layers of a pre-trained model with your own data, in fine-tuning transfer learning, you might train 1-3+ layers of a pre-trained model (where the '+' indicates that many or all of the layers could be trained).
